# SpinachDataset

This dataset will contain aprox 8000 images of spinach (4000 label and 4000 unlabel). I need time to prepare the dataset.

All the images are label as "Espinaca", meaning Spinach in spanish. Sorry if that is a problem to you.

The label images are resize to 800 * 600 to fit in 16gb of RAM.

Also you will find the full size unlabel images taken with a Sony CyberShot.
